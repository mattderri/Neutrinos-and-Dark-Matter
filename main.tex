\section{Cosmology}
We know that the universe is expanding so the question is: \textit{is it accelerating?} We can answer this question by using the \textbf{comoving coordinates}, defining with $r$ the comoving distance. Moreover, we introduce a \textbf{scale factor} $a(t)$ which defines how the space expands and contracts. Therefore, the distance between the two objects is given by:
\[
d(t)=r\cdot a(t)\to\Dot{d}(t)=r\cdot\Dot{a}(t)
\]
Putting these two expressions together gives us:
\beginbox{Hubble Constant}
\[
v(t):=\Dot{d}(t)=\frac{\Dot{a}(t)}{a(t)}d(t)=H(t)d(t)
\]
\endbox
Where we have defined the ratio $\frac{\Dot{a}(t)}{a(t)}$ as the \textbf{Hubble constant} $H(t)$ (although it is \textit{not} really constant). At a reference time $t_0$ chosen to be today, it is possible to compute the value of the Hubble constant:
\[
v(t_0)=H_0\cdot d(t_0)\to H_0=68\,\text{km/(Mpc$\cdot$s)}=2\cdot10^{-18}\,\text{s$^{-1}$}
\]
Knowing now the value of $H_0$, it is then possible to solve the differential equation\\
$\Dot{d}(t_0)=H_0\cdot d(t_0)$, which gives us:
\[
d(t)=d(t_0)\exp{H_0(t-t_0)}\simeq d(t_0)[1+H_0(t-t_0)]
\]
where we have performed a first order approximation since $H_0$ is small. Moreover, we can also see how the volume increases:
\[
V(t)=V(t_0)\exp{3H_0(t-t_0)}\simeq V(t_0)[1+3H_0(t-t_0)]
\]
Taking now the ratio of these two expressions allows us to compute the \textbf{Hubble time}.
\beginbox{Hubble Time}
\[
t_H:=\frac{1}{H_0}=\frac{d(t_0)}{V(t_0)}=14.4\,\text{Gy}
\]
\endbox
This value is really close to the actual age of the Universe, 13.7 Gy. This discrepancy can be explained by considering the fact that the Hubble constant was greater in the past.\\
If we compute the distance that light has travelled during this time, we end up with:
\[
d(t_0)=c\cdot t_H=\frac{c}{H_0}=4300\,\text{Mpc}
\]
Light is not fast enough to reach objects from this distance. However, this is not in contrast with relativity because at this distance objects cannot \textit{talk} to each other. This distance tells us the size of what we can see in the Universe.\\
A phenomenon strictly related to the Hubble constant is the one of \textbf{redshift}:
\[
Z=\frac{\lambda_{\text{obs}}-\lambda_{\text{e}}}{\lambda_{\text{e}}}
\]
The scale factor $a(t_0)$ today is, by definition, 1, hence:
\[
\lambda_{\text{obs}}=\lambda_{\text{e}}\frac{a(t_0)}{a(t_{\text{e}})}
\]
The scale factor $a(t_{\text{e}})$ is smaller than 1 so today we observe longer wavelengths with respect to the time of their emission. It is possible to obtain a relation between the redshift and the scale factor. To do that, start with rewriting $Z$ as follows:
\[
Z=\frac{\lambda_{\text{obs}}}{\lambda_{\text{e}}}-1=\frac{a(t_0)}{a(t_{\text{e}})}-1=\frac{1}{a(t_{\text{e}})}-1
\]
Moreover, we know that $d(t)=r\cdot a(t)$, from which we can write:
\[
a(t)=a(t_0)[1+H_0(t-t_0)]=1+H_0(t-t_0)\to\frac{1}{a(t_{\text{e}})}=\frac{1}{1+H_0(t_{\text{e}}-t_0)}\simeq1-H_0(t_{\text{e}}-t_0)
\]
Therefore, at first order in our expansion we have:
\beginbox{Redshift}
\[
Z=H_0(t_0-t_{\text{e}})
\]
\endbox
Typically, what is observed is light for which it holds true that:
\[
d=c\Delta t=\frac{Zc}{H_0}
\]
This is how the Hubble constant was firstly measured.\\
With all this machinery, our goal is now to derive the \textbf{Friedmann equation}. Suppose to have a test mass $m$ on the edge of a sphere with radius $R$ which encloses a total mass $M$. The dynamics of the test mass is:
\[
m\Ddot{R}(t)=-G\frac{mM}{R^2(t)}
\]
We are interested in $\Ddot{R}(t)$ which is the acceleration per unit mass. Take into account now the \textbf{energy density}, defined as follows:
\[
\varepsilon=\int dt\Ddot{R}(t)\Dot{R}(t)=\int d\Dot{R}\Dot{R}(t)=\frac{\Dot{R}^2}{2}
\]
However, we can express $\Ddot{R}(t)$ from the dynamics of the test mass, resulting in:
\[
\varepsilon=\int dt\left(-G\frac{M}{R^2(t)}\right)\Dot{R}(t)=-GM\int \frac{dR}{R^2(t)}=\frac{GM}{R(t)}\Rightarrow\frac{\Dot{R}^2}{2}=\frac{GM}{R(t)}+U
\]
We take a look at the possible values of $U$:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $U>0$: the object escapes the gravitational force since $\Dot{R}(0)>$\,escape velocity
    \item $U=0$: $\Dot{R}(0)=$\,escape velocity
    \item $U<0$: $\Dot{R}(0)<$\,escape velocity
\end{itemize}
At this point we have to take into account that the sphere we are considering might change its volume and density, assuming that the total mass $M$ stays fixed:
\[
M=\frac{4}{3}\pi R^3(t)\rho(t)\to\Dot{R}^2=R_0^2\Dot{a}^2(t)=\frac{8}{3}\pi G\rho(t)R_0^2a^2(t)+2U
\]
where we used the fact that $R(t)=R_0a(t)$. Last thing left to do is to divide both sides by $R_0^2a^2(t)$ which gives us:
\beginbox{Friedmann Equation (classical derivation)}
\[
H^2(t)=\left(\frac{\Dot{a}(t)}{a(t)}\right)^2=\frac{8}{3}\pi G\rho(t)+\frac{2U}{R_0^2a^2(t)}
\]
\endbox
What we have done so far was a classical treatment, now we move to the relativistic case where the energy density can be expressed as $\varepsilon(t)=\rho(t)c^2$. The tricky part comes when we have to define the initial conditions, which were simply given by the factor proportional to $U$ in the previous formulation. Working with \textbf{Minkowski metric}, we know that:
\[
ds^2=-cdt^2+dr^2+r^2d\Omega^2=-cdt^2+dr^2+r^2[d\theta^2+\sin^2\theta d\varphi^2]
\]
However, instead of working with $r^2d\Omega^2$ we use $S_k^2(r)d\Omega^2$ where $S_k$ is defined as:
\[
S_k=\left\{\begin{aligned}
&R_0\sin(r/R_0) &&\text{if $k=1$, positive curvature}\\
&r &&\text{if $k=0$, zero curvature}\\
&R_0\sinh(r/R_0) &&\text{if $k=-1$, negative curvature}
\end{aligned}\right.
\]
The \textbf{Robertson-Walker metric} for a homogeneous, isotropic and expanding (or contracting) Universe is:
\[
ds^2=-cdt^2+a^2(t)[dr^2+S_k^2(r)d\Omega^2]
\]
General relativity tells us that $2U$ goes into $-kc^2$, therefore we have:
\beginbox{Friedmann Equation (relativistic version)}
\[
H^2(t)=\left(\frac{\Dot{a}(t)}{a(t)}\right)^2=\frac{8\pi G}{3c^2}\varepsilon(t)-\frac{kc^2}{R_0^2a^2(t)}
\]
\endbox
Now we can perform some tricks, i.e. dividing everything by $H^2(t)$ and defining the \textbf{critical density} as:
\[
\frac{1}{\varepsilon_c(t)}:=\frac{8\pi G}{3c^2H^2(t)}
\]
Plugging this into the previous expression one gets:
\[
1-\frac{\varepsilon(t)}{\varepsilon_c(t)}=-\frac{kc^2}{R_0^2a^2(t)H^2(t)}
\]
This tells us that if we are able to measure the ratio $\frac{\varepsilon(t)}{\varepsilon_c(t)}$ we can tell the sign of $k$, hence the curvature of the Universe. The expression above can be rewritten in a more compact and elegant form:
\[
1=\Omega_\varepsilon+\Omega_c
\]
where $\Omega_\varepsilon=\frac{\varepsilon(t)}{\varepsilon_c(t)}$ and $\Omega_c=-\frac{kc^2}{R_0^2a^2(t)H^2(t)}$. Now we want to move even further and compute the ratio $\frac{\Ddot{a}(t)}{a(t)}$:
\[
\Dot{a}^2(t)=\frac{8\pi G}{3c^2}\varepsilon(t)a^2(t)-\frac{kc^2}{R_0^2}\xrightarrow[\text{derivative}]{}2\Dot{a}(t)\Ddot{a}(t)=\frac{8\pi G}{3c^2}[\Dot{\varepsilon}(t)a^2(t)+2\varepsilon(t)a(t)\Dot{a}(t)]
\]
Dividing everything by $2a(t)\Dot{a}(t)$ we get:
\[
\frac{\Ddot{a}(t)}{a(t)}=\frac{4\pi G}{3c^2}\left[\frac{a(t)}{\Dot{a}(t)}\Dot{\varepsilon}(t)+2\varepsilon(t)\right]
\]
$\Dot{\varepsilon}(t)$ can be computed using some \textbf{thermodynamics}. The Universe is isolated, therefore one can write:
\[
0=dQ=dE+pdV=\Dot{\varepsilon}(t)V(t)+\varepsilon(t)\Dot{V}(t)+p\Dot{V}(t)
\]
where we used the fact that the energy can be expressed as $E=\varepsilon(t)V(t)$. Moreover, we know that:
\[
V(t)=\frac{4}{3}\pi R^3(t)=\frac{4}{3}R_0^3a^3(t)\to\Dot{V}(t)=4\pi a^2(t)\Dot{a}(t)R_0^3=3V(t)\frac{\Dot{a}(t)}{a(t)}
\]
We substitute this in the expression above to find:
\[
\Dot{\varepsilon}(t)+3(\varepsilon(t)+p)\frac{\Dot{a}(t)}{a(t)}=0\Rightarrow\Dot{\varepsilon}(t)=-3\frac{\Dot{a}(t)}{a}(\varepsilon(t)+p)
\]
Now that we know the expression for $\Dot{\varepsilon}(t)$ we can write:
\[
\frac{\Ddot{a}(t)}{a(t)}=\frac{4\pi G}{3c^2}\left[-3\varepsilon(t)-3p+2\varepsilon(t)\right]=-\frac{4\pi G}{3c^2}[\varepsilon(t)+3p]
\]
This is telling us that with \textit{only} gravitational force the Universe would \textbf{contract}, there should be something else in opposition to the negative sign. This \textit{something else} is the \textbf{cosmological constant} $\Lambda$:
\beginbox{Cosmological Constant} 
\[
\frac{\Ddot{a}(t)}{a(t)}=-\frac{4\pi G}{3c^2}[\varepsilon(t)+3p]+\frac{\Lambda}{3}
\]
\endbox
Assume now that the contribution of the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ is the dominant one and that $H(t)$ is constant over a short time-scale, hence:
\[
\Ddot{a}(t)=H(t)\Dot{a}(t)=H^2(t)a(t)\to H^2(t)\frac{\Ddot{a}(t)}{a(t)}\simeq\frac{\Lambda}{3}
\]
It is therefore possible to extend the Friedmann equation:
\beginbox{Full Metal Friedmann Equation}
\[
H^2(t)=\left(\frac{\Dot{a}(t)}{a(t)}\right)^2=\frac{8\pi G}{3c^2}\varepsilon(t)-\frac{kc^2}{R_0^2a^2(t)}+\frac{\Lambda}{3}
\]
\endbox
Dividing everything by $H^2(t)$ gives us:
\[
1=\Omega_\varepsilon(t)+\Omega_c(t)+\Omega_\Lambda(t)
\]
It is also possible to divide by $H^2(t_0)$ to get:
\[
\frac{H^2(t)}{H^2(t_0)}=\frac{\Omega_m^0}{a^3(t)}+\frac{\Omega_r^0}{a^4(t)}+\frac{\Omega_c^0}{a^2(t)}+\Omega_\Lambda^0
\]
Nowadays, the dominant contribution is given by $\Omega_\Lambda^0$ while at the beginning of the Universe with a small value of $a(t)$, the term proportional to $\Omega_r^0$ was the dominant one. In the expression above, the energy contribution of $\varepsilon(t)$ had been splitted into contribution from matter $\varepsilon_m(t)$ and contribution from waves $\varepsilon_r(t)$. The Friedmann equation can be written as:
\[
\frac{H^2(t)}{H_0^2}=\frac{8\pi G}{3c^2H_0^2}\left[\frac{\varepsilon_m(0)}{a^3(t)}+\frac{\varepsilon_r(0)}{a^4(t)}\right]-\frac{kc^2}{R_0^2a^2(t)H_0^2}+\frac{\Lambda}{3H_0^2}
\]
Moreover, we computed the acceleration/fluid equation, introducing also the cosmological constant. We now want to establish a relation between distance and redshift but to do that we have to go to \nth{2} order in the expansion:
\[
\Dot{a}(t)=H(t)a(t)\to\Ddot{a}(t)=\Dot{H}(t)a(t)+H(t)\Dot{a}(t)=\Dot{H}(t)a(t)+H^2(t)a(t)
\]
From this expression, it follows that:
\[
\frac{\Ddot{a}(t)}{H^2(t)a(t)}=1+\frac{\Dot{H}(t)}{H^2(t)}:=-q
\]
where we introduced a new parameter called \textbf{deceleration}. If $q<-1$ it means that the Hubble parameter is increasing. At this point, it is possible to take the scale factor and compute it at the time the light was emitted from the supernova.
\[
\begin{aligned}
a(t_{\text{e}})&=a(t_0)+\Dot{a}(t)\Bigr|_{\substack{t=t_0}}(t_{\text{e}}-t_0)+\frac{1}{2}\Ddot{a}(t)\Bigr|_{\substack{t=t_0}}(t_{\text{e}}-t_0)^2\\
&=1+H_0(t_{\text{e}}-t_0)+\frac{(-q)}{2}H_0^2(t_{\text{e}}-t_0)^2
\end{aligned}
\]
With the same reasoning, we can perform an expansion also on the redshift $Z$:
\[
Z=\frac{1}{a(t_{\text{e}})}-1=H_0(t_{\text{e}}-t_0)+\frac{q}{2}H_0^2(t_{\text{e}}-t_0)^2
\]
We now have a \nth{2} order equation for the redshift as a function of the time when the light was emitted. We have to compute to \nth{2} order also the distance:
\[
d(t)=\frac{ca(t_0)}{a(t)}dt=\frac{c}{a(t)}dt\Rightarrow d=\int_{t_{\text{e}}}^{t_0}dt\frac{c}{a(t)}
\]
Since we need to stay at \nth{2} order, we take only the \nth{1} order contribution from the expansion of $a(t)$, since it will become a \nth{2} order contribution when integrating.
\[
d=c\int_{t_{\text{e}}}^{t_0}dt[1-H_0(t-t_0)]=c(t_0-t_{\text{e}})-\int_{t_{\text{e}}-t_0}^{0}dt'H_0t'=c(t_0-t_{\text{e}})+\frac{H_0}{2}(t_0-t_{\text{e}})^2
\]
Skipping all the details, we finally obtain the relation between distance and redshift.
\[
d=\frac{cZ}{H_0}\left[1-\frac{1+q}{2}Z\right]
\]
If we measure $Z$ and $H_0$ and it is not a straight line, then there is a dependence on the $q$ parameter.\\
To compute $\Omega_r$, we start by looking at the \textbf{black body radiation}. We ask ourselves: \textit{how many photons can we fit in a box at temperature $T$?}
\[
1D: \nu_1=\frac{c}{2L}\to\nu_m=\frac{c}{2L}m\;m=1,2,\dots,\infty \quad 3D: \nu=\frac{c}{2L}\sqrt{m_x^2+m_y^2+m_z^2}
\]
Since it can go up to infinity, a better choice is to compute the density of modes.
\[
N_mdm=\frac{4\pi}{8}m^2dm=\frac{\pi}{2}m^2dm\to N_md\nu=\frac{\pi}{2}\left(\frac{2L}{c}\right)^3\nu^2d\nu
\]
To know the number photons, we use the Bose statistics.
\[
N_\gamma d\nu=\frac{2}{\exp{\frac{h\nu}{kT}}-1}N_md\nu=\frac{8\pi L^3}{c^3}\frac{\nu^2}{\exp{\frac{h\nu}{kT}}-1}d\nu
\]
We do not want a dependence on $L$, so we compute the density $n_\gamma$.
\[
n_\gamma d\nu=\frac{N_\gamma}{L^3}d\nu=\frac{8\pi}{c^3}\frac{\nu^2}{\exp{\frac{h\nu}{kT}}-1}d\nu
\]
Moreover, from this expression it also possible to obtain the energy density:
\[
\varepsilon_\gamma(\nu)=h\nu n_\gamma=\frac{8\pi h}{c^3}\frac{\nu^3}{\exp{\frac{h\nu}{kT}}-1}\to\varepsilon_\gamma=\int_0^\infty d\nu\varepsilon_\gamma(\nu)=\alpha T^4
\]
where $\alpha=7.6\cdot10^{-16}$\;J/(m$^3$K$^4$). If we repeat the same strategy for $n_\gamma$, we get:
\[
n_\gamma=\beta T^3 \quad \beta=2\cdot10^7\;\text{m$^{-3}$K$^{-3}$}
\]
At a certain point, hydrogen atoms started to form (\textbf{recombination}) and electrons were removed from this plasma. The electron density decreased so the photons could escape (\textbf{decoupling}). The rate of interaction is given by:
\[
\Gamma(t)=n_e(t)\sigma_Tc
\]
If $\Gamma(t)<H(t)$ it means that there cannot be any interaction because the Universe is expanding too fast. We then have decoupling of photons at $Z=1090$ and $T=2970$\;K. This results in $a(t)\sim10^{-3}$. Moreover, the wavelength is re-scaled $\lambda_\gamma=\lambda Z$, i.e. the energy is reduced by a factor $\sim1000$ having then $T\sim2.97$\;K. The CMB temperature is precisely measured to be $T_0=2.7$\;K. We know there is a black body distribution, so we can plug this in the expressions obtained before to find:
\[
n_\gamma^0=4\cdot10^8\;\text{m$^{-3}$} \quad E_{\text{mean}}=2.7 kT_0=630\,\text{$\mu$eV/photon}\xrightarrow[\text{1 GHz=4 $\mu$eV}]{}160\;\text{GHz}
\]
This results in an energy density equal to $\varepsilon_\gamma^0=0.26$\;MeV/m$^3$ but the critical energy density is $\varepsilon_c^0=4.9$\;GeV/m$^3$. This tells us that the contribution from radiation $\Omega_\gamma^0=5\cdot10^{-5}$ is negligible today.
\section{Dark Matter}
\textbf{Dark matter} (DM) decoupled way before photons, therefore there was a distribution of DM which created a lot of potential wells and consequently attracted other mass. Density started to become larger, increasing temperature. This lead to an expansion in volume which lead to the temperature decreasing and so on. We then observe \textbf{acoustic oscillations} which propagates at speed $c_s=\frac{c}{\sqrt{3}}$. What distance do they travel?
\[
d=c_s\int_0^{t_{\text{ls}}}dt\frac{a(t_{\text{ls}})}{a(t)}=0.145\;\text{Mpc}
\]
However, we are able to observe these waves today and we know that the maximum distance a photon can travel to reach us is $d_{\text{hor}}=14$\,Gpc. Taking into account also redshift we end up with $d_{\text{A}}=\frac{d_{\text{hor}}}{Z}=13$\,Mpc.\\
We computed $\Braket{T}$ but now we are interested in fluctuations, so we define:
\[
C(\theta)=\Braket{\frac{\delta T}{T}\Bigr|_{\substack{\Vec{n}}}\cdot\frac{\delta T}{T}\Bigr|_{\substack{\Vec{n}'}}} \quad \frac{\delta T}{T}=\sum_{l,m}a_{l,m}Y_{l,m}(\theta,\varphi)
\]
where $\Vec{n}\cdot\Vec{n}'=\cos\theta$. Doing the cross product gives us:
\[
C(\theta)=\sum_lC_l(2l+1)P_l(\cos\theta)
\]
For unknown reasons, cosmology likes to plot the following quantity:
\[
\Delta_T=\frac{l(l+1)}{2\pi}C_l\Braket{T^2}
\]
Combining results from supernovae and CMB, we end up with:
\[
\Omega_m^0=0.3 \quad \Omega_\Lambda^0=0.7 \quad \Omega_k^0=0
\]
Define now $\eta=\frac{n_B^0}{n_\gamma^0}=6\cdot10^{-10}$, this is interesting because we know from the average temperature of CMB $n_\gamma^0=4\cdot10^8$\,m$^{-3}$, therefore we can compute $n_B^0$:
\[
n_B^0=6\cdot10^{-10}\cdot4\cdot10^8\,\text{m$^{-3}$}=0.24\,\text{m$^{-3}$}\Rightarrow\varepsilon_B^0=0.24\,\text{GeV/m$^3$}
\]
Since $\varepsilon_c^0=5$\,GeV/m$^3$ this results in $\Omega_B^0=0.05$. There is another piece in the puzzle, $\Omega_m^0=0.3$ so there is another 0.25 missing which is an evidence for the existence of dark matter.\\
Another evidence comes from \textbf{rotational velocity} of galaxies. The surface brightness is given by $I(R)=I_0e^{-R/R_v}$. It typically falls off exponentially with distance from the center. For $R>R_v$ we are basically enclosing all the visible mass of the galaxy. For our galaxy, $R_v=4$\,kpc. If we are at a distance $R>R_v$, from the Gauss law we get:
\[
\frac{v^2}{R}=\frac{GM(R)}{R^2}\to v=\sqrt{\frac{GM(R)}{R}}
\] 
However, this is not what is measured: this is telling us that the mass we are enclosing cannot be just the visible one. There are different models to describe dark matter density:
\beginbox{Navarro-Frank-White Model}
\[
\rho=\frac{\rho_0}{\left(\frac{R}{R_d}\right)^\gamma\left[1+\left(\frac{R}{R_d}\right)^\alpha\right]^{\frac{\beta-\gamma}{\alpha}}}
\]
\endbox
For our galaxy the parameter $\gamma=\alpha=1$, $\beta=3$, $R_d=20$\,kpc. For $R<R_v$, the density goes like $\rho\sim\frac{1}{R}$ and we get $\rho_0=0.3$\, Gev/cm$^3$.\\

\noindent\\
We want to prove that for relativistic particles the pressure is negligible, to do that we do a little exercise.\\
\textit{Exercise: compute the pressure of a non-relativistic gas of particles.}\\
From thermodynamics, it is well known that $pV=NkT=nRT$. Now we assume that $p=f(\varepsilon)$:
\[
p=f(\varepsilon)=\frac{N}{V}kT=nkT \quad n=\frac{\rho}{\mu}
\]
where $n$ is the number of particles per unit volume, expressed as the ratio between the density and the mean mass $\mu$ of the particle. Since we are dealing with a non-relativistic gas:
\[
\rho=\frac{\varepsilon}{c^2}\to n=\frac{\varepsilon}{\mu c^2}\Rightarrow p=\frac{kT}{\mu c^2}\varepsilon=W\varepsilon
\]
Moreover, we know how to link the average velocity of the particles and the temperature of the gas:
\[
\frac{3}{2}kT=\frac{1}{2}\mu\Braket{v}^2\to W=\frac{kT}{\mu c^2}=\frac{\Braket{v}^2}{3c^2}\ll1
\]
Because we are in a non-relativistic regime. In the relativistic case instead, we find $W_R=\frac{1}{3}$ which leads to:
\[
p=W\varepsilon=W\rho c^2\to c_s=\sqrt{\frac{dp}{d\rho}}=c\sqrt{W}=\frac{c}{\sqrt{3}}
\]
Exactly what we found for the acoustic oscillations.\\
\textit{Exercise: compute the value of $a$ and $Z$ at which the Universe started expanding.}\\
The input parameters are $\Omega_m^0=0.3$ and $\Omega_\Lambda^0=0.7$.
\[
-q=\frac{\Ddot{a}(t)}{a(t)H^2}=-\frac{\Omega_m}{2}+\Omega_\Lambda=-\frac{\Omega_m^0}{2a^3(t)}+\Omega_\Lambda=0
\]
This tells us that the values we want are:
\[
a(t)=\left(\frac{\Omega_m^0}{2\Omega_\Lambda}\right)^{1/3}=0.6 \quad Z=\frac{1}{a(t)}-1=0.67
\]
\hline\\
\noindent\\
So far, we know that $\Omega_m=0.3$ but $\Omega_B=0.05$ therefore $\Omega_{DM}=0.25$. Now we ask ourselves: \textit{what is dark matter made of?} There are some hypothesis on its nature. With CMB, we looked at a surface of photons, now we are more interested in the 3D distribution. 
\[

From measurements, we understand that the large majority of dark matter is due to non-relativistic particles, i.e. \textbf{cold dark matter}. Given a DM particle $\chi$, in principle we could observe two processes: annihilation of $\chi\chi$ into two Standard Model particles \textit{or} production of two $\chi\chi$ starting from two Standard Model particles. There is also a dilution effect due to the factor $a^3(t)$: given a density $n(t)=\frac{N}{a^3(t)}$ we can see how it evolves with time.
\[
\Dot{n}(t)=-\frac{3N}{a^4(t)}\Dot{a}(t)-3n(t)H(t)
\]
Then, for annihilation and production one finds:
\[
\Gamma_a=nv\sigma_a\to\Dot{n}_a(t)=-n(t)\Gamma_a=-n^2(t)v\sigma_a \quad \Gamma_p=n_{SM}v_{SM}\sigma_p\to\Dot{n}_p(t)=n^2_{SM}(t)v_{SM}\sigma_p
\]
At the equilibrium, production and annihilation should compensate each other:
\[
n_{eq}^2v\sigma_a=n_{SM}^2v_{SM}\sigma_p\Rightarrow\Dot{n}(t)=-3n(t)H(t)+\Dot{n}_p(t)+\Dot{n}_a(t)=-3n(t)H(t)+\sigma_av(n_{eq}^2-n^2)
\]
Keeping $n$ close to $n_{eq}$, we get:
\[
n_{eq}\propto T^{3/2}\exp{-\frac{m_\chi c^2}{kT}}
\]
If we know $\Omega_{DM}^0$ and make some reasonable hypothesis on $m_\chi$ then we can compute $n^0$.
\[
\Omega_{DM}^0=\frac{0.24}{\sigma_av/c} \quad \sigma_a=G_F^2m_\chi^2(\hbar c)^2 \Rightarrow m_\chi=5\,\text{GeV}
\]
This is telling us that we are dealing with \textbf{weakly interacting massive particles} (WIMP).\\
In the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM), every SM particle has a partner with a spin difference of $1/2$. In particular, for the gauge bosons we have the neutralinos $\chi_1, \chi_2, \chi_3$. Suppose now that $\chi_1$ is the lightest supsersymmetric particle and it is a WIMP candidate: how do we detect it? The idea is to observe nuclear recoil in elastic scattering. We do not look at electron recoil because in order to get the maximum energy transfer the mass of the target should be similar to the mass of the projectile. It is a better idea to use heavy nuclei, which can vary in a wide mass range since $m_\chi\in[5,100]$\,GeV. But even with all these ingredients how can we model an interaction we know nothing about? We have to make some hypothesis on the interaction, i.e. on the cross section.
\[
\left\{
\begin{aligned}
&\text{Axial:}&&\alpha_A(\overline{\chi}\gamma^\mu\gamma^5\chi)(\overline{n}\gamma_\mu\gamma^5n)\to\text{spin dependent}\\
&\text{Vector:}&&\alpha_V(\overline{\chi}\gamma^\mu\chi)(\overline{n}\gamma_\mu n)\to\text{spin independent}\\
&\text{Scalar:}&&\alpha_S(\overline{\chi}\chi)(\overline{n}n)\to\text{spin independent}
\end{aligned}
\right.
\]
For the spin independent interactions, we have:
\[
\sigma_{\text{SI}}^0\propto G_F^2\mu^2A^2
\]
where $\mu$ is the reduced mass. For the axial case instead, we see the total spin of the nucleus:
\[
\sigma_{\text{SD}}^0\propto G_F^2\mu^2J^2
\]
In general, the total cross section as a function of the momentum transfer $q$ can be expressed as:
\[
\sigma(q)=\sigma_{\text{SI}}F_{\text{SI}}(q)+\sigma_{\text{SD}}F_{\text{SD}}(q)
\]
This is usually written as:
\[
\sigma(q)=\sigma_{0,\text{nucleon}}\left[\frac{\mu(\chi,A)}{\mu(\chi,\text{nucleon})}A\right]^2
\]
However, we do not directly measure the cross section but rather the rate of interaction $R$, more precisely the rate per unit mass.
\[
R=\frac{N_A}{A}\sigma v_\chi n_\chi
\]
We know that $n_\chi=0.3$\,GeV/m$^3$, we need to make some assumption on $v_\chi$. Let's move back to our galaxy, where we assume that we are surrounded by a sphere of dark matter.
\[
f(\Vec{v}_\chi)=\exp{-\frac{\Vec{v}_\chi^2}{2v_{\text{mean}}^2}}
\]
After some non interesting calculations that we will not do, it turns out that $2v_{\text{mean}}^2=v_0^2$ which is the disk velocity at the solar system, hence it is possible to write in the end:
\[
f(\Vec{v}_\chi)=\exp{-\frac{\Vec{v}_\chi^2}{v_0^2}}
\]
Since it is rotating, we have an apparent wind of DM arriving from the Cygnus constellation (just an apparent movement).
\[
\Vec{v}=\Vec{v}_\chi-\Vec{v}_{\text{Earth}}\Rightarrow f(\Vec{v})\propto\exp{-\frac{(\Vec{v}_E+\Vec{v})}{v_0^2}}
\]
where $v_0=230$\,km/s is the velocity of the disk, $v_E=240$\,km/s is the Earth velocity, $v_\chi$ is the DM velocity in the rest frame and $v$ is the DM velocity observed at the Earth. The relative difference between $v_0$ and $v_E$ gives birth to a \textbf{modulation} of the interaction rate through the year.\\
The recoil energy of the nucleus after the scatter of an angle $\theta$ in the center of mass is given by:
\[
E_{\text{NR}}=E_\chi 4\frac{m_\chi m_A}{(m_\chi+m_A)^2}\frac{1-\cos\theta}{2}
\]
We assume that the scatterings are isotropic, i.e. uniform in $\cos\theta$ so that the recoils are uniformly distributed in $E_{\text{NR}}$. The signal is measured in counts/(keV$\cdot$day$\cdot$kg) which is the Dark Matter Rate Unity (DRU). The main challenge for experimental detection is given by the presence of \textbf{background} which does not allow to have a clear signal.
